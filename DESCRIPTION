Description: Traditional model evaluation metrics fail to capture model 
    performance under less than ideal conditions. This package employs 
    techniques to evaluate models "under-stress". This includes testing 
    models' extrapolation ability, or testing accuracy on specific 
    sub-samples of the overall model space. Details describing stress-testing 
    methods in this package are provided in 
    Haycock (2023) <doi:10.26076/2am5-9f67>. The other primary contribution of
    this package is provided to R users access to the 'Python' library 'PyCaret'
    <https://pycaret.org/> for quick and easy access to auto-tuned 
    machine learning models.
